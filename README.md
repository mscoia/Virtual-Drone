The basis of this project was to create a virtual drone hub which creates a number of drones and assigns targets within a 
grid layout for them to travel to and then return.  Each drone was created in its own thread and collisions within the grid were avoided.

The program uses a makefile to initialize the program's files.  It should work with any basic C compiler.
